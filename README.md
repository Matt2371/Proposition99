# Proposition99 and the Synthetic Control Method
Summary of the synthetic control method as proposed by (Abadie et al., 2010). We demonstrate the method using data from California's Proposition 99 (tobacco control), asking the question if significant causal effects can be found from Proposition 99 on the lowering of cigarette sales in California.
